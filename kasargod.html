<h4>
    Kasaragod district, which is located at the northern end of Kerala, was formed on 24th May, 1984. The District formed on the basis of the order of 19.05.1984 of GO (MS) number 520/84 / RD, comprising of Hosdurg and Kasaragod taluks which were part of undivided Kannur District. In the east the district is Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, the Arabian Sea in the west, and the Kannada District of Karnataka in the north. The district is bounded by the Kannur district.

We can say that Kasaragod is the crown of the state Kerala, Land of many differnt languages, the history of the invasion and resistance, testimonies of historical forts, remainings of innovative culture of the modern stone age like ‘Chenkallarakal’, ‘Nannangatikal’, ‘Muniyarakal’, Inscriptions of historical rulers and their practices, Lush green land of highlands of western ghat, the midlands, the unique traditions and practice of worship. Kasargod is reputed for its practice of sharing the culture and languages.
The name Kasaragod resembles ‘a group of trees of Kanjira’. In the collection of poems of the poet Linkanna uses the term “Kasaragod” as ‘Thullu Rajaraller Malerite’. Kasaragod is no longer a group of Kanjira wood, land that is rich in lush green areca palm, coconut trees and bananas and hugged by beaches of Arabian Sea. Kasaragod is rich in history and heritage.

        Built almost 300 years ago, Bekal Fort is considered as one of the largest and most preserved forts in Kerala. Nestled in the lap of nature, Bekal Fort is a historic fort surrounded by a beautiful beach offering an enchanting view of Arabian Sea from its high observation tower where once the cannons were placed. The beautiful walkway, illuminated beach and the grand architecture of the Bekal Fort make this place a favourite among the masses. The fort was featured in the popular A R Rahman song ' Tu hi re'.

        Located at 65 kms away from Mangalore, Bekal Fort is a keyhole-shaped lofty structure that stands still against the rocky shores of sea amusing its visitors with its finesse. The whole purpose of erecting this structure by Shivappa Nayaka of Bednore in the year 1650 was pure of defence.
        There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on the beach along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a whole new dimension to its beauty.

The innocent life of the village and gentle nature make a perfect blend of delight and enjoyment. The entire trek route of Ranipuram is very scenic and a  delight for nature photographers. The trek lasts for about two and a half kilometres, and the summit has a cave, and reaching it is quite an adventurous experience.
        It makes for a perfect picnic spot where one can even come across the occasional herd of elephants. Once known as Madathumala, it borders Karnataka and boasts of some of the best trekking trails in the area. Regular buses are available on this route and jeep rides are another favourite among all our visitors. The versatile vegetation that includes evergreen shola woods, monsoon forests and grasslands make it a good place to relax and take some time off from the rigors of daily life.

        Ananthapura Lake Temple is a serene Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake located in Village Ananthapura, Kasargod. It is a holy temple of Ananthapadmanabhan Swami. It is believed that Ananthapadmanabhan settled down here first and then moved to Thiruvananthapuram through a cave which lies to the right-hand side corner of the lake. The cave is said to be a natural structure that separates Ananthapura and Thiruvananthapuram and therefore, these two temples retain the name of the same deity.

        The Ananthapura Lake Temple is a perfect example of nature living in total harmony with each other, and it indeed is, as it is seen by the presence of a crocodile in spite of humans visiting the temple to offer their prayers. Babiya never attacks the humans even when they use the tank for taking a bath and humans never treat him differently and together they maintain a blended and peaceful existence. One has to visit this temple to experience total harmony.
