<h4>
    Idukki, a landlocked district of Kerala, is one of the most nature-rich areas in Kerala with more than half of the area covered with forest. This rugged hill resort is known for its wildlife sanctuaries, beautiful bungalows, tea factories, rubber plantations and forests.

Idukki's speciality lies in 650 feet long and 550 feet high arch dam across the Kuravan Kurathi mountain, which is the largest in the country. Anamudi, which is the highest peak in India, south of the Himalayas, is also located in Idukki. Idukki is one of the districts in the state that has abundant scope for promotion of eco-tourism if proper infrastructure and promotional activities are provided.

      <p>
        The second highest peak in Southern India, Meesapulimala stands elevated at an altitude of 2641 meters (8660 feet ) above sea level. The densely covered terrain has eight peaks that together resemble a moustache and is, therefore, called Meesapulimala. Also, considered as a hotspot of diversity, Meesapulimala has been recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site.
        This mountain range is a trekker’s paradise in the Southern parts of India, and is located just a small distance away from the beautiful Munnar town of Idukki district in Kerala. The name of the peak is derived from the fact that it is made of a total of eight peaks. All of these mountains are spread out and have a moustache like formation. The mountain range is sandwiched between Anaimalai Hills and the Palani Hills, which are located near Suryanelli. 

        The beauty of the mountain range can only be fully appreciated  if you trek to the top of the mountain. To that end, first, you have to take a jeep to the base camp and then hike to the top of the mountain. However, this route should only be undertaken by veteran hiking enthusiasts, as it can be quite grueling. Most of the travelers prefer to undertake an easier trek from Rhodovalley to Meesapulimala, which is 8 km long. You can also hike to the mountains from Silent Valley, which is located 6 km away from Rhodo Valley.

      <h3>Anchuruli Waterfalls</h3>

      <p>
        Situated amongst the gushing locations in Western Ghats Land and providing an enchanting view of the semi-evergreen forests grasslands, Anchuruli Waterfalls (also spelt as Anjuruli) is a surreal location definitely worth visiting. The water that comes from Erattayar River is used for the Idukki hydro-electric project. A tunnel which is 2 km long passes through Erattayar and Anchuruli carrying water to the lake. Though the tunnel is dangerous, it is a fun place to take a stroll at especially for all the adventure lovers.
        This gushing water that comes from Erattayar River is stored here for the Idukki hydro-electric project. Anjuruli is a picturesque picnic spot with a splendid view of semi-evergreen forest, grassland and hilly areas of the Western Ghats. Anchuruli is also an ideal place for fishing. A 4.75 km tunnel passes through the mountain, connecting Erattayar and Anchuruli. Water passes through this tunnel and drains into the lake. The adventurous ones can walk into the tunnel during summer although it is dangerous. Pullumedu is another place worth visiting.

        The best time for visit Anchuruli waterfalls is after the rainy season. Trekking is possible with the prior permission from the Divisional forest Office at Kanchiyar.

        An ideal picnic spot situated in the Idukki District of Kerala, the Cheruthoni Dam being 138 m tall is the largest concrete gravity dam close to the Idukki Arch Dam. Constructed across the Periyar River, this third highest dam in the country was built in 1976 as a part of the Idukki Hydroelectric project along with two other dams namely Kulamavu and Idukki.

        The dam is looked after by the Kerala State Electricity Board and also rents out boats to engage in the two-hour cruise between Kulamavu and Idukki. On the way, visitors are spellbound by the beauty that this place offers and the enchanting views of the sunrise and sunset that one gets to experience from here. From the great height at which the Cheruthoni Dam is situated, one can view certain parts of the Kochi city on a clear day. However, one can reach the dam only by walking or via a jeep.

      <p>
        Situated in Kulamavu, the Kulamavu Dam is a gravity dam. The dam part of three dams dedicated to the Idukki Hydro Electric Power Plant that also encloses a manmade lake. Although quite mundane, this dam is a good place for some short sightseeing.

        Besides, Kulamavu dam is also part of the state's largest river, Periyar's power ventures. However, photography is not allowed here. There are occasional boating facilities at the lake here. Quite close to the dam are a few eating options.
