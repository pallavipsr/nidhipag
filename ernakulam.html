        Bolgatty Palace is located in Bolgatty Island of Kochi and is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces that is situated outside Holland. It is an exquisite example of the Kochi style of architecture. Built-in 1744 by Dutch traders, it was later extended, and gardens were landscaped around it. Green gardens, azure skies and the virgin charms of Kerela are aplenty at the Bolgatty Palace.The building was then the Governor's palace for the commander of Dutch Malabar, and in 1909 was leased to the British. It served as the home of the British governors, being the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.

        In 1947, when India attained independence, the palace became the property of the state and was converted into a heritage hotel resort.
