Built to promote mythology and adventure tourism, the tourism centre boasts of 6D theatre, a digital audio-visual room, cable car and ayurvedic cave resort. It is also home to umpteen adventure activities including paintball, laser tag, archery, bouldering, rock climbing, air-rifle shooting etc. The primary attraction of the park, however, is the world's largest stone-cut bird sculpture replicating Jatayu, the mythical bird from Ramayana.
        Being the first of its kind destination tourism initiative, it redefines Kerala's haven! It is conceptualized and designed by the Malayali director Rajiv Anchal and has been constructed in collaboration with the state government. The project is first of its kind with public-private partnership under BOT (Built-Operate-Transfer) model. The concept is to bring art, epic, history and technology together. It is located on the exact same hill where the demi-god Jatayu fell after being defeated by Ravana in a fight to save Sita from his clutches. Alongside being the major tourist attraction, the park also sets to provide rainwater harvesting and renewable energy sources to the localities. In fact, the electricity required for the project is also harnessed from solar power.

        Palaruvi Falls, cascading downstream from the height of 300 ft, is one of the prime attractions in Kutrallam or as some call it Courtallam, Tamil Nadu. Owing to its height; it is the 32nd highest fall in our country. The name Palaruvi means 'Stream of Milk' in the regional language.

        Ironically it seems to be a glittering stream of milk as it flows down. Hence, the beauty of this fall stands unimaginable till witnessed with own eyes. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it.
        Situated in the Thenmala ranges, Palaruvi falls are surrounded by lush green forests, the Kallada River and some minor waterfalls. The enchanting place is perfect for savouring nature's beauty. The fall not only does have an alluring beauty but also is considered sacred by the locals. The milk-like water is worshipped by people who believe it to be a religious spot.
