<h4>
  The word “Malappuram” (terraced place atop the hills) came to represent the present region only after the formation of the district, before it was called Eranad or Valluvanad

  The district has a rich cultural and political heritage. From the time immemorial the port of Ponnani (sometimes roughly identified withTyndis) was a centre of trade with the Romans. After the Cheras, numerous powerful dynasties controlled the area, and by 9th century the region came to hands of the Kulasekharas of Mahodayapuram. After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom a number of Naircity states emerged called Valluvanad, Vettathunad, Parappanad, Nediyiruppu (the Zamorins) and more. But, from 13th century theSamoothiri of Calicut expanded their territories to the whole of Malabar. Thirunavaya, the seat of Mamankam, was in Malappuram district. European colonial powers landed in Malabar in 15th century, and changed the course of the history. The petty vassals of theSamoothiris often allied with the foreign powers against their rule. In 18th century, the de facto rulers of Mysore kingdom, Hyder Ali andTipu Sultan, marched to Samoothiris’ districts.
